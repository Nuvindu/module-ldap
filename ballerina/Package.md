## Overview

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is an vendor-neutral software protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services. It allows users to locate organizations, individuals, and other resources such as files and devices in a network. LDAP is used in various applications for directory-based authentication and authorization.

The Ballerina LDAP module provides the capability to efficiently connect, authenticate, and interact with directory servers. It allows users to perform operations such as searching for entries, modifying entries in an LDAP directory, providing better support for directory-based operations.

### APIs associated with LDAP

- **modify**: Updates information of an entry in a directory server.
- **getEntry**: Gets information of an entry in a directory server.

        displayName: "Updated User"
    };
    _ = check ldapClient->modify(userDN, user);
}
```
